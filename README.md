## Unhandled error in Next.js API Route

This example demonstrates an unhandled error in a Next.js API route that causes a runtime error in the client-side component.  The `About` page fetches data from an API route, but if there's an error (e.g., a typo in the URL or the API is down), the error isn't gracefully handled, causing the application to crash.

The solution shows how to properly handle errors using try-catch blocks and display user-friendly error messages.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe the error in the console and the application's behavior.
